This is a small project for me to remind myself how to design a web application with just html, css, and javascript.
The purpose of this is to refresh my head from the boxed thinking of working only within a framework like React or Vue.

The app so far has these functionalities so far: add task, done/delete task, save and load tasks.

Here is how it look so far

changing and choose color theme

js element manipulation (create element, delete element...)
